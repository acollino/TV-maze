Show Search is a browser app that lets you search for a TV series, pulling up the series poster, its summary, and making the full episode list available to you with the click of a button!

Give it a try here: https://acollino.github.io/TV-maze/

This app was created in VSCode using starter code from Springboard - the initial HTML was provided, and the CSS stylesheet was also written by Springboard. It uses the Axios API to manage AJAX requests and uses the TV Maze API to look up the series information (available here: https://www.tvmaze.com/api). Feel free to contact me with feedback about this or my other projects!
